We are committed to creating software products that are accessible, easy to use, and intuitive for all users. Our design philosophy is centered around two key principles:

## 1. Design for No Code Users

We believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background. To achieve this, we design our products with the end-users in mind, making them as intuitive as possible, even for those without any coding experience.

## 2. Low Learning Curve

We also believe that simplicity is key. Our products are designed with a minimalistic approach, with clean and straightforward interfaces that are easy to navigate. We prioritize extendability, so that our products can easily adapt and grow as needed.
