## Pre-Incident

We understand that errors are a normal part of software engineering. However, we must be mindful of the number of errors we can afford to make. It's important that we never blame anyone personally but instead focus on the code and the system.

## During Incident

📞 If you receive an on-call notification, please acknowledge your presence by writing a message in the #on-call channel. This will help us ensure that we have the right person on call and can quickly resolve any issues.

🚨 If you're unsure how to handle a particular issue, escalate it to the relevant team member for further guidance.

🤝 We appreciate your help and commitment to keeping our systems running smoothly, even during off-hours. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

## Post-Incident

Please open a ticket to track the incident and collaborate with the team to identify actionable items to prevent similar issues from happening in the future.

## Playbook

A detailed playbook with step-by-step instructions for handling various incidents will be provided soon.
