We will create a flow that sends a message to a Slack channel every 1 hour, and call it Big Ben ‚è∞

### 1. Create a new collection.

You should see the following screen after setting up your account. Click on **Start building** to create a new collection.

This will also create your first flow `Flow 1` inside the collection. You can change its name from `Untitled` to `Big Ben`.

You will see the following screen, choose the Schedule trigger:

We'll now set the Schedule to run every hour by using this expression `0 0 * ? * *` in the settings, as follows:

### 4. Test the flow.

Your flow is complete, it's time to test it. Click on **Test flow** right above your flow.

Once the test is completed, you'll receive the message in the Slack channel you chose and the builder will turn like this:

The check mark means the step ran successfully. You can click on any step and see its input and output.

### 5. Publish the collection.

To enable your automation, click on the **Publish** button on the top of the screen. This will save the collection as a new version and automatically enable it.

It's official, you are ready to use Activepieces now üéâ
