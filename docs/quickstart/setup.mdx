<Note>We are currently working on 2 other setup methods: 1-Click Install on DigitalOcean and a cloud version. You can use the Docker image to install Activepieces today.</Note>

We will use Activepieces [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) image to get up and running quickly:

**1. Clone Activepieces repository.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces.git
```

**2. Go to the repository folder.**

```bash
cd activepieces
```

**3. Run Activepieces.**
```bash
docker compose -p activepieces up
```

**4. Head to https://localhost:8080 on the browser and set up your account.**

You are now ready to build your first flow. We will do this in the next guide.
