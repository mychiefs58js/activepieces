<Note>We are currently working on 2 other setup methods: 1-Click Install on DigitalOcean and a cloud version. You can use the Docker image to install Activepieces for now.</Note>

We will use Activepieces Docker image to get up and running quickly.

**1. Clone Activepieces repository.**

Use the command line to `cd` to your preferred directory, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces.git
```

**2. Go to the repository folder.**

```bash
cd activepieces
```

**3. Run Activepieces.**

This assumes that Docker is installed on your machine. Otherwise, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) first.

```bash
docker compose -p activepieces up
```

**4. Head to https://localhost:8080 on the browser and set up your account.**

You are now ready to build your first flow. We will do this in the next guide.
