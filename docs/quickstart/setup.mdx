<Note>We are currently working on 2 other setup methods: 1-Click Install on DigitalOcean and a cloud version. You can use the Docker image to install Activepieces for now.</Note>

# Docker compose

We will use Activepieces Docker image to get up and running quickly.

**1. Clone Activepieces repository.**

Use the command line to `cd` to your preferred directory, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces.git
```

**2. Go to the repository folder.**

```bash
cd activepieces
```

**3. Run Activepieces.**

This assumes that Docker is installed on your machine. Otherwise, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) first.

```bash
docker compose -p activepieces up
```

**4. Head to https://localhost:8080 on the browser and set up your account.**

You are now ready to build your first flow. We will do this in the next guide.

# Gitpod

To test the activepieces project, you can use Gitpod by clicking on the button below. This will open the activepieces repository in Gitpod's online workspace.

<Tip>
Please make sure to allow popups in your browser. The installation process should open a link automatically at the end, but if it doesn't, you can access it by clicking on the "Ports" button in the bottom right corner of the screen and click on port 8080 link.
