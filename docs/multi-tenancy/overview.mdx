# Multi-Tenancy

<Tip>
This feature is available under our closed beta, please contact us support@activepieces.com, 
If you are interested in trying this out.
</Tip>

***It is assumed that you are already familiar with activepieces' key concepts.***

In this tutorial, we will explain how activepieces supports multi-tenancy.

The multi-tenancy feature is used for product integrations, allowing for automation flows to be run on behalf of users based on their individual configurations.

**Example:** Your product aims to send notifications to your customers' Slack workspaces.


## Manage Connections

Activepieces offers a frontend SDK that allows you to gather credentials from your users and establish `connections` within your Activepieces project, which can be named according to your preference. Additionally, Activepieces manages OAuth2 authentication by keeping tokens refreshed.

## Use Connections Dynamically

<Warning>
Currently, connections can only be used dynamically inside code pieces.

Support for using them dynamically with other pieces will be available soon.
</Warning>

You can use connection dynamically inside flows by passing `${connections.CONNECTION_NAME}` to a code piece.

This will be resolved to the connection project during flow execution. The object will look like the following:

```json
{
  "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
  // Any Extra data returned by the third party will be placed inside data.
  "data": {

  }
}
```


# Javascript SDK

We will show you how to use a JavaScript SDK to collect credential within your website. 

Once the credentials have been collected, we will demonstrate how to use them in an flow.

## Install Activepieces SDK

You can install Activepieces SDK into your application with a small snippet of JavaScript in your website:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
loadActualAPSdk();var loadSdkPromise;function loadActualAPSdk() {	loadSdkPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {		const scriptTag = document.createElement('script');		//replace source with url from cdn		scriptTag.src = 'SDK_URL';		scriptTag.onload = () => {			setApInWindow();			resolve();		};		scriptTag.onerror = err => {			reject(err);		};		scriptTag.async = true;		document.head.append(scriptTag);	});}function setApInWindow() {	const apSdk = document.createElement('ap-sdk');	document.body.append(apSdk);	window.ap = apSdk;}ap = {};const methodNames = ['init', 'connect', "disconnect", "isConnected"];for (const method of methodNames) {	ap[method] = (...args) => {		return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {			loadSdkPromise.then(				() => {					window.ap[method](...args).then(						val => resolve(val),						err => reject(err)					);				},				err => reject(err)			);		});	};}
</script>
```

## Identify Your user

Before using Activepieces SDK, you will need to setup your application so that you can identify your users to Activepieces.

### 1. Get Your Signing Key:

<Warning>
Signing keys are currently obtained by manually contacting the Activepieces team.

For security reasons, Activepieces does not store these keys. If a key is lost, a new one will need to be generated by contacting Activepieces again.
</Warning>

### 2. Get Your User Token

The signing key will be used to generate JWT tokens for the currently logged-in user on your website, which will then be sent to Activepieces to create a connection with the collected credentials.

To generate these tokens, you will need to add code in your backend and ensure the tokens are signed using the RS256 algorithm. 

The signed tokens must include the "sub" and "exp" claims at a minimum:

```json
{
	// Unique identification of your connection name.
	"sub": "the-user-id",

	// Expiry timestamp for token, such as 1 day from time of generation
	"exp": 1608603716
}
````

#### Examples:

The following are snapshot code examples from different JWT libraries for creating the user token. You can also use this tool to generate a quick example: https://dinochiesa.github.io/jwt/.

```javascript NodeJs
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// JWT NumericDates specified in seconds:
const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
let token = jwt.sign({
        sub: "user-123",
        exp: currentTime + (24 * 60 * 60), // 1 day from now
    },
    process.env.ACTIVEPIECES_SIGNING_KEY, {
        algorithm: "RS256",
    }
);
```

### 3. Authenticate with Activepieces

Finally, you can use the Connection token in javascript by using the following SDK method on your frontend:

```javascript
ap.init({
  projectId: "PROJECT_ID",
  token: "CONNECTION_TOKEN",
  host: "ACTIVEPIECES_SERVER_URL"
})
```

## Connect

<Warning>
You must contact activepieces to register your app credentials. Once this is done, you can provide the appName to connect.
</Warning>

To open authentication for certain app use the following:

```javascript
ap.connect({
  appName: "gmail"
})
```

When this is successful, you will see the following screen and the app will be available in the connections tab of the activepieces dashboard.

## Disconnect

To disconnect from the app, you can use the following code:

```javascript
ap.disconnect({
  appName: "gmail"
})
```
