## Key Concepts

Let's explain the the terminology and structure we are going to use to build custom piece for third party api.

* `Piece`:
* `Prop`:
* `Trigger`:
* `Action`:

## Folder Structure 

All pieces are belong to the package `src/pieces/apps`, the piece folder structure is like this.

```
.
├── apps
│   ├── app_name
|   │   ├── common
|   │   ├── triggers
|   │   ├── actions
|   │   ├── index.ts
```

* `common`: contains common utils and props such as oauth2 connection.
* `triggers`: contains triggers.
* `actions`: contains actions.
* `app_name/index.ts`: contains the app defintiion.
