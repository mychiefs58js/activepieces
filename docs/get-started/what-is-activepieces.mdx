Activepieces is an open source web-based automation tool that allows you to automate your work by creating "flows" of data transfer between your apps.

For example, you could use Activepieces to automatically add a lead to a MailChimp audience once they're inserted in a Google Sheet, or to send a Slack notification for each new GitHub issue.

In the middle, you can use helper pieces or write code to modify the shape of the transferred data between the steps.
