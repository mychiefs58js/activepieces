In this section, you'll learn how to create automation flows, integrate with available apps and customize the trigger for your automation.

This guide will take you through the steps to create "Hello World" flow that sends a message to a Slack channel every hour.

## Create Demo account

To get started, visit https://demo.activepieces.com/sign-up and create an account using any email and password.

The information you enter will not be retained and the data will be deleted every 24 hours. Note that no 
email address confirmation is needed for this demo account.

## Create Hello World Flow

You should see the following screen after setting up your account. Click on **Start building** to create a new collection.

This will also create your first flow `Flow 1` inside the collection. Think of a collection as a folder for your flows.

You can change the name of the flow from `Untitled` to `Hello World`.

### 2. Configure the trigger.

To be able to send a message every hour, we need a scheduler that would start our flow on fixed time intervals.

Once you click on the `Empty Trigger`, choose the Schedule trigger from the Core menu:

![Select Flow Trigger](/resources/screenshots/quickstart-configure-trigger.png)

<Note>To know more about other types of triggers, visit [Triggers](/using-activepieces/triggers) page.</Note>

We'll now set the Schedule to run every hour by using this expression `0 0 * ? * *` in the settings, as follows:

<Note>You can learn more about Cron expressions in the [Triggers](/using-activepieces/triggers) page</Note>

### 3. Add a Slack piece.

While **Trigger** is what starts a flow, the actual logic of the flow happens in **Pieces**. Pieces perform a specific task or operation.
They can be external services (Apps) or data processors (Helpers). 

Since we would like to send a message to Slack, we will need a Slack piece.

Click on the **+** button below the trigger:

The Pieces panel will open. Go to the **Apps** tab and choose **Slack**.

App pieces have **Actions**.  Actions are the different ways you could integrate with the App. Since we want to send a message, we'll choose *Send slack message* action.

Depending on the action chosen, several fields need to be specified for the action to work. 

For our case, we need to define *Authentication* with Slack first. Click on **+ New Authentication**. You are then prompted to either use Activepieces slack app credentials or create your own developer app
on Slack and add your credentials. For simplicity, choose to use Activepieces app and log in to Slack.

Next, you need to choose the desired channel to send your message. Choose the channel from the dropdown menu.

Last but not least, write down the text of the message. Eg: "Activepieces is cool!".

### 4. Test the flow.

Your flow is complete! It's time to test it. Click on **Test flow** right above your flow.

Once the test is completed, you should receive the message in the Slack channel you chose and the builder will turn like this:

![Test Flow](/resources/screenshots/quickstart-test-flow-completed.png)

The check mark means the step ran successfully. You can click on any step and see its input and output.

### 5. Publish the collection.

To enable your automation, click on the **Publish** button on the top of the screen. This will save the collection as a new version and automatically enable it.
Your flow now is running in the background. 

It's official, you are ready to use Activepieces now ðŸŽ‰
