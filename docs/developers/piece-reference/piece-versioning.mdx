Pieces are npm packages and follows **semantic versioning**.

## Semantic Versioning

The version number consists of three numbers: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:

- **MAJOR** It should be incremented when there are breaking changes to the piece.
- **MINOR** It should be incremented for new features or functionality that is compatible with the previous version.
- **PATCH** It should be incremented for bug fixes and small changes that do not introduce new features or break backward compatibility.

## Engine
The engine will always try to use latest **major** version when the user selected the piece.

## Examples
<Tip>
when you make a change, remember to increment the version accordingly.

Changes that are **not backward compatible** include:
- Changing the logical behavior of actions or triggers.
- Removing or modifying properties types.

Changes that are **backward compatible** include:

- Adding optional parameters.
- Fixing bugs.
- Fixing typos or updating descriptions.
