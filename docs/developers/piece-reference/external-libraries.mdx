The Activepieces repository is structured as a monorepo, employing Nx as its build tool.

To use an external library in your project, you can simply add it to the main package.json file and then use it in any part of your project.

NX will automatically detect where you're using the library and include it in the build. 


Here's how to install and use an external library:

- Install the library using ```npm install --save <library-name>``` 

- Import the library into your piece.
