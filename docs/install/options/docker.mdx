<Tip>
Set up Activepieces using Docker Compose for easy deployment - Ideal for personal and testing with SQLite3 and in-memory queue. 
For production (companies), use PostgreSQL and Redis, Refer to docker compose setup.
</Tip>

To get up and running quickly with Activepieces, we will use the Activepieces Docker image. Follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

You need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine in order to set up Activepieces via Docker Compose.

## Install

### Pull Image and Run Docker image 

Pull the Activepieces Docker image and run the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v ~/.activepieces:/root/.activepieces -e AP_QUEUE_MODE=MEMORY -e AP_DB_TYPE=SQLITE3 -e AP_FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:8080" activepieces/activepieces:latest
```

### 4. Configure Webhook URL (Important for Triggers, Optional If you have public IP)

**Note:** By default, Activepieces will try to use your public IP for webhooks. If you are self-hosting on a personal machine, you must configure the frontend URL so that the webhook is accessible from the internet.

**Optional:** The easiest way to expose your webhook URL on localhost is by using a service like ngrok. However, it is not suitable for production use.

1. Install ngrok
2. Run the following command:
```bash
ngrok http 4200
```
3. Replace `AP_FRONTEND_URL` environment variable in `.env` with the ngrok url.
