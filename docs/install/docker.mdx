To get up and running quickly with Activepieces, we will use the Activepieces Docker image. Follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

You need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine in order to set up Activepieces via Docker Compose.

## Installing

**1. Clone Activepieces repository.**

Use the command line to clone Activepieces repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces.git
```

**2. Go to the repository folder.**

```bash
cd activepieces
```

<Warning>
Please ensure the instance is accessible from the internet so that third-party services can send payloads to activepieces. 

When deploying for production, ensure that you update the database credentials and properly set the environment variables.

Review the [configurations guide](configurations.mdx) to make any necessary adjustments.
</Warning>

**3. Run Activepieces.**

```bash
docker compose -p activepieces up
```

To upgrade to new versions, which are installed using docker compose, perform the following steps. First, open a terminal in the activepieces repository directory and run the following commands.

<Tip>
