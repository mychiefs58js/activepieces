To get up and running quickly with Activepieces, we will use the Activepieces Docker image. Follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

You need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine in order to set up Activepieces via Docker Compose.

## Installing

**1. Clone Activepieces repository.**

Use the command line to clone Activepieces repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces.git
```

**2. Go to the repository folder.**

```bash
cd activepieces
```

**3. Run Activepieces.**

```bash
docker compose -p activepieces up
```

## 4. Configure Webhook URL (Important for Triggers, Optional If you have public IP)

By default, the backend will try to use your public IP. If you are self-hosting on a personal machine, you must configure the backend URL so that the webhook is accessible from the internet.

The easiest way to expose your webhook URL on localhost is by using a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). To set this up, follow these steps:

1. Install ngrok
2. Run the following command:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```
3. Replace `AP_BACKEND_URL` environment variable in `packages/.env` with the ngrok url.

<Warning>
When deploying for production, ensure that you update the database credentials and properly set the environment variables.

Review the [configurations guide](configurations.mdx) to make any necessary adjustments.
</Warning>

## Upgrading

To upgrade to new versions, which are installed using docker compose, perform the following steps. First, open a terminal in the activepieces repository directory and run the following commands.

<Tip>
Please review the [Changelog](https://activepieces.com/docs/changelog) for any breaking changes.
</Tip>

**1. Pull the new docker compose file**
```bash
git pull
```

**2. Pull the new images**
```bash
docker compose pull
```

3. Run the updated docker images
```
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

Congratulations! You have now successfully updated the version.
