Data travels through the flow starting from the trigger until the last piece in the flow.

This allows flows to be so powerful as you can design each step to work with the flowing data.

There are two types of data that you can use in any step:

- Output from previous steps: `${step_name.output_variable}`
- Config variables: `${configs.variable_name}`

We'll go through both types in detail.
