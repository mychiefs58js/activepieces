It's helpful to understand the concepts Activepeices is built on before starting to use the software. Here is a quick introduction to these:

## Flow

A flow is an automation sequence. It always has to start with a [Trigger](#trigger) that is followed with a sequence of [Steps](#step).

Changes to flows must be [published](#publishing) as a new version in order to take effect.

### Trigger

A trigger is the first step of any flow. It chooses **when** or **how frequently** the flow will run.

There are 3 main types of triggers that you should understand, as explained in the following table:

| Trigger | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| Schedule | Runs on a regular schedule that you define | Run flow once a day |
| Webhook | Runs in reaction to an external event | Run when another app completes a process |
| App Trigger | Runs in reaction to predefined apps events | Run when a new contact is added to MailChimp |

You can read the [Triggers page](./triggers) for a detailed guide to their different types and their usage.

### Step

A step is the building block of the flow. Any flow will have at least one step, the Trigger.

Other steps will follow the Trigger and will run consequently as per the flow design.

These steps can be any variant of [Pieces](../pieces/overview).

### Collection

Flows are automatically organized into collections, which are groups of flows similar to folders or packages.

When publishing flows, you publish the entire collection rather than a single flow.

Similarly, when enabling flows, you enable the entire collection rather than a single flow.

Inside a collection, you can view the flows as tabs at the top of the screen and add or remove any of them using the tab bar.

### Publishing

When you build your flows for the first time, you must publish them in order to enable them.

If you make changes to published flows, the changes won't take effect until you publish them again under a new version.

This publishing process protects your running flows from breaking while you're in the process of modifying them.

The following table explains the difference between Publish and Enable:
| Operation | Description |
| - | - |
| Publish | Saves collection changes under a new version |
| Enable | Activates the collection |
| Disable | Deactivates the collection |
