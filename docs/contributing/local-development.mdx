title: 'Local Development'

This project utilizes Docker Compose for local development, allowing you to edit the application on your own computer while the files are running inside a Docker environment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed on your local machine.

## Using Docker Compose

First, install the necessary dependencies for your application by running the following command:

```bash
npm ci
```

Next, start the application by using the command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

This command will start the containers specified in the docker-compose.dev.yml file and run them in the background. You can use the `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down` command to stop the containers.
