## Workflow

1. Choose a Piece: 

If you don't have a particular piece in mind, you can refer to the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/activepieces/projects/5) to check the priorities. Once you have chosen a piece, comment on the issue to claim it, and it will be assigned to you to avoid duplicate work.

2. Develop: 

Develop the piece locally and test it end-to-end. 

3. Documentation:

If your piece requires documentation, please add it to the same piece directory in a file called `piece_name.mdx`, look at this example: [discord.mdx](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/blob/main/packages/pieces/apps/src/lib/discord/discord.mdx)
The auto-generator will move it to the `docs` folder.

3. Review: 

Open a pull request to the main branch, and we will review it as soon as possible.
