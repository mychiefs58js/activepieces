## 1. Read the Tutorial

To get the full benefit, it is recommended to read the [quickstart guide](quickstart) first.

## 2. Configure Webhook URL (Important for Triggers)

You must configure the backend URL so that the webhook is accessible from the internet. 
Check the section below for instructions.

The easiest way to expose your webhook URL on localhost is by using a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). To set this up, follow these steps:

1. Install ngrok
2. Run the following command:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

3. Replace `AP_BACKEND_URL` environment variable in `packages/backend/.env` with the ngrok url.

Once you have completed these configurations, you are ready to go!
