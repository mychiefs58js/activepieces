This tutorial explains three techniques for creating triggers:

- `Polling`: Periodically call endpoints to check for changes.
- `Webhooks`: Listen to user events through a single URL.
- `App Webhooks (Subscriptions)`: Use a developer app (using OAuth2) to receive all authorized user events at a single URL.

# Trigger Structure

```typescript
export const createNewIssue = createTrigger({
    name: string, // Unique name across the piece.
    displayName: string, // Display name on the interface.
	description: string, // Description for the action
    triggerType: POLLING | WEBHOOK,
	
    props: {}; // Required properties from the user.
    // Run when the user enable or publish the collection.

	onEnable: (ctx) => {};
    // Run when the user disable the collection or
    // the old collection is deleted after new one is published.
	onDisable: (ctx) => {};
    
    // Trigger implementation, It takes context as parameter.
    // should returns an array of payload, each payload considered
    // a separate flow run.
    run: async run(ctx): unknown[] => {}
})
```

<Tip>
It's important to note that the `run` method returns an array. 
The reason for this is that a single polling can contain multiple triggers, so each item in the array will trigger the flow to run.

# Techniques

## Polling

The way polling triggers usually work is as follows:

**On Enable:**
Store the last timestamp or most recent item id using the context store property.

**Run:**
This method runs every **5 minutes**, fetches the endpoint between a certain timestamp or traverses until it finds the last item id, and returns the new items as an array.

**Testing:**
You cannot test it with Test Flow, as it uses static sample data provided in the piece. 
To test the trigger, publish the collection, perform the event, and wait for the run to be invoked (every 5 minutes) on the third party. Then check the flow runs from the main dashboard.

**Examples:**
- [New Completed Task On Todoist](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/blob/main/packages/pieces/apps/src/lib/todoist/triggers/task-completed-trigger.ts)

## Webhooks

The way webhook triggers usually work is as follows:

**On Enable:**
Use `context.webhookUrl` to perform an HTTP request to register the webhook in a third-party app, and store the webhook Id in the `store`.

**Run:**
You can find the HTTP body inside `context.payload.body`. If needed, alter the body; otherwise, return an array with a single item `context.payload.body`.

**Disable:**
Using the `context.store`, fetch the webhook ID from the enable step and delete the webhook on the third-party app.

**Testing:**
You cannot test it with Test Flow, as it uses static sample data provided in the piece. 
To test the trigger, publish the collection, perform the event. Then check the flow runs from the main dashboard.

**Examples:**
- [New Form Submission on Typeform](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/blob/main/packages/pieces/apps/src/lib/typeform/trigger/new-submission.ts)

<Warning>
To make your webhook accessible from the internet, you need to configure the backend URL. Follow these steps:

1. Install ngrok.
2. Run the command `ngrok http 3000`.
3. Replace the `AP_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable in `packages/backend/.env` with the ngrok URL.

Once you have completed these configurations, you are good to go!
</Warning>

## App Webhooks (Not Supported)

Certain services, such as `Slack` and `Square`, only support webhooks at the developer app level. 
This means that all authorized users for the app will be sent to the same endpoint. While this technique will be supported soon, for now, a workaround is to perform polling on the endpoint.
