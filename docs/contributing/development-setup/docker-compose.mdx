The `docker-compose.dev.yml` file is a Docker Compose file contains all external services required.

## Requirements
- Node.js version 18 or higher & npm installed

## Steps

Here are the steps to use `docker-compose.dev.yml`:

1. Run the script to install node_modules 
```bash
node tools/setup-dev.js
```

2. Run the following command to start postgres & redis:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

<Warning>
**Troubleshoot 1:**
The IP address 0.0.0.0:5432 is already in use. This suggests that another PostgreSQL on your device is currently active, leading to a port conflict.

Please stop the existing service or edit the environment variables in `packages/backend/.env`
</Warning>

**Troubleshoot 2:**
The IP address 0.0.0.0:6379 is already in use. This suggests that another Redis on your device is currently active, leading to a port conflict.

Please stop the existing service or edit the environment variables in `packages/backend/.env`
</Warning>

3. Run the backend & frontend
```
npm run start:native
```

4. Go to ***localhost:4200*** on your web browser and sign in with these details:

Email: `dev@ap.com`
Password: `12345678`

<Tip>
**Friendly Tip #1:**
By default, you won't be able to see all the pieces unless you build or modify something in the pieces package while serving the backend. 

To build the pieces, you should use the corresponding to project name in the `project.json` inside piece package for example:
`npx nx build pieces-discord`
