# Code Structure

The repository is `nx` with `package-based` to manage different packages.

```
.
├── packages
│   ├── frontend
│   ├── server
│   ├── engine
│   ├── components
│   ├── worker
│   ├── shared

```
* `frontend`: based on `angular` framework to implement the user interface.
* `server`: based on `fastify` framework for api implementations.
* `engine`: contains the logic for flow execution inside the sandbox.
* `components`: contains the third party app implementations for trigger and actions.
* `worker`: contains the logic for bundling code actions, scheduling and execute the flows in sandbox.
* `shared`: contains data models and helper functions that's shared between all other packages.
