# Create Your First Piece


### 1. Development Setup

Fork the repository and you can set up the development environment using one of the following methods:

- **[Codespaces](./development-setup/codespaces)**: This is the **quickest** way to set up the development environment.
- **[Docker Compose](./development-setup/docker-compose)**: It is the **recommended** method for local development.
- **[Dev Container](./development-setup/dev-container)**: This method is suitable for remote development on another machine.
