---

The repository is structured as a monorepo using the NX build system, with TypeScript as the primary language. It is divided into several packages:

```
.
├── packages
│   ├── frontend
│   ├── server
│   ├── engine
│   ├── components
│   ├── worker
│   ├── shared

```

- `frontend`: This package contains the user interface, implemented using the Angular framework.
- `server`: This package contains the API implementation, using the Fastify framework.
- `worker`: This package contains the logic for the flow worker and code worker.
- `engine`: This package contains the logic for flow execution within the sandbox.
- `components`: This package contains the implementation of triggers and actions for third-party apps.
- `shared`: This package contains shared data models and helper functions used by the other packages.
