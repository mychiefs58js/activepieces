## Step 1: Add an iframe

After inserting an iframe into your document, set its source to `<your_instance_url>/embed`. If you are using the cloud, just use `cloud.activepieces.com/embed`.

**Query Parameters:**
| Parameter Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| jwtToken | ✅ | To create the JWT token, refer to [this guide](/platform/managed-users).
| hideSidebar | ❌ | Its value can be either false or true, and it controls the visibility of the sidebar in the dashboard.

## Step 2: Add the Activepieces script

To ensure navigation synchronization between the vendor and Activepieces, add the following script to your vendor app:
```
<script src="https://cdn.activepieces.com/sdk/embed-sdk.js">
```
After adding the script, you will gain access to the `activepieces` object, on which you need to call the `configure` method with the following parameters:

# Activepieces.configure Method:
| Parameter Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prefix | ✅ | You must choose a URL prefix for generating URLs. URL prefixes for embedding follow this pattern: `<embedding_url_prefix>/<Activepieces_url>`. For example, if the prefix is `/automation` and the Activepieces URL is `/flows`, the corresponding vendor URL will be `/automations/flows`.
| initialClientRoute | ❌ | Its value must be one of the following: `/flows`, `/runs`, `/connections`, `/flows/:id`, `/runs/:id`. Any other path will result in a 404 page. If left undefined, it will redirect to `/flows`.
