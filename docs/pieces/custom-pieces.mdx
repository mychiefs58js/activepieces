We understand that pieces are a crucial part of using Activepieces to automate your work. If you are looking for a specific piece and can't find it in the docs or in the repo, you can take one of the following actions:

**1. Use helper pieces**

In many cases, helper pieces can get you the outcome you desire. Here are some examples:

- If you'd like to communicate with a service that has APIs, you can use the generic [HTTP Request piece](./helpers/http-request) to send the request to that service.

- If you'd like to parse a CSV file as an array, you can use the [Code piece](./helpers/code) with a relevant npm package to achieve your goal.

**2. Request the piece**

The community is working actively on adding more pieces to the official GitHub repository, and with the guidance from users, building priorities become clearer.

You can put your piece request in front of the community by upvoting a similar existing request or add a new request to the [Piece Requests](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/discussions/categories/piece-requests) category on GitHub Discussions.

**3. Make the piece**

If you are a developer and don't wish to wait until the piece is built by the community, we've put up a [guide to building a new piece](/building-pieces).

You can follow the structure and steps in the guide to build your piece for your own use or to contribute with it to Activepieces.
