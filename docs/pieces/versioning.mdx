Pieces are versioned for the sole purpose of not breaking flows with each update we role out.

You can check the current step's piece version by looking under the step's settings.

To update a step's piece version, you will need to remove the step and add it again.

<Warning>
We are working on imporving the experience for updating a step's piece version.

Semantic versioning is a standardized way of versioning software projects. It uses a three-part version number in the format `X.Y.Z`, where:

**X** is the major version number, which is incremented for significant or breaking changes to the software.<br />
**Y** is the minor version number, which is incremented for new features or functionality that is backwards-compatible with the previous version.<br />
**Z** is the patch number, which is incremented for bug fixes and other small changes that do not add new features or break backwards compatibility.
