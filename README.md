## Getting the most of PostHog

See [PostHog Docs](https://posthog.com/docs/) for in-depth walk-throughs on functionality.

Join our [Slack community](https://posthog.com/slack) if you need help, want to chat, or are thinking of a new feature. We're here to help - and to make PostHog even better.

## Philosophy

We help you understand user behavior and build better products without losing control of your data. 

In our view, third-party analytics tools do not work in a world of cookie deprecation, GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, and many other four-letter acronyms. PostHog is the alternative to sending all of your customers' personal information and usage data to third-parties.

PostHog is designed to give you every tool you need to understand user behavior, create hypothesis and release changes to make your product more successful.

## What's cool about this?

PostHog is the only **product-focused** open-source analytics suite, with an event, user and group architecture that **you can host in any infrastructure**. 

We are an open-source alternative to products such as Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap, HotJar, Pendo or Full Story. We're designed to be more developer-friendly, with the broadest range of features like session recording, heatmaps, feature flags, and plugins.

We play nicely with data warehouses and other services - you can _import_ event or user data by writing a plugin to create transformations, or you can _export_ data by using our existing data exports to BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, etc. All without losing control of your data.
